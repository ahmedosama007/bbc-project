# BBC Clone

This project is a clone of the [BBC] home page, created as a part of the El-Manara Front-End course. The aim of this project is to showcase what we learned about HTML, CSS, responsive design, and other front-end technologies.

## Features

- The website has a similar layout and style as the original BBC website, with some modifications and simplifications.
- The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- The website uses semantic HTML elements and follows the web accessibility guidelines.
- The website uses CSS variables, flexbox, grid, and media queries to create a modern and consistent design.
- The website uses vanilla JavaScript to add some interactivity and functionality, such as a hamburger menu.
